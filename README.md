# EnumManagedStates

A project that demonstrates a program's transitions while downloading and displaying data, implemented with booleans and with enums / states.

The point is to show the benefits of managing program transitions using states over booleans, especially when one compares the code for the 2 different implementations.

While this project was built in SwiftUI and runs on the iOS platform, the principles of enums and state machines are applicable across programming languages.

Used as the demo for my talk at the Women Who Code Connect Forward conference on December 4, 2020.
